# Exercise 04 - HTML Forms

Welcome to exercise 04 - let's build a form.

## Steps

1. Create a folder on your local machine to work in and open it up in VSCode
2. Create an `index.html` file in your local working folder
3. Copy the contents of the `index.html` file in this repository into your newly created `index.html` file
4. Using your knowledge of semantic HTML and tables, start wrapping the blocks of text in the `index.html` file in HTML tags
5. Add appropriate HTML semantic elemants and table elements to the page
6. The image of the City of Ottawa is in the `\images` folder which you will also need to copy to your local machine (I put a `width="500"` attribute on the image so that it wouldn't be so big)
7. Use the screen capture / image below to help you structure the document. Your page should look like it at the end of the exercise
8. If you get stuck, have a look inside the `\solutions` folder for one way of putting this together
